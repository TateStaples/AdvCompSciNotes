## Description
Yolo (You Only Look Once) is one of the fastest object tracking algorithms. It does this 

### Guard dog
Will constantly watch the camera for any people walking by. When its spots someone, it will start making a barking 
sound, and it will not stop until the person leaves. I am looking into adding this to a smart doorbell like wring.

To use, just run guarddog.py

### Quipper
This is similar to guard dog in that it will play audio when a person walks by. However, it will do so far less frequently 
and will randomly choose a quote. This is a replacement for many of my friends who only make 3 specific jokes on repeat :).

To use, place the directory of audio files in resources. Next, go into quipper.py and set quip_type to the name of the 
directory you added.

## Other Applications
While most of these programs are not very serious, YOLO has some very powerful applications. From self driving cars that
can identify signs, pedistrians, and more to automated sports drones that can follow you and record extreme stunts. 
Computer Vision is advancing at a really quick pace.
